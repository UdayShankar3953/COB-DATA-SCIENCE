# Data Science Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Data Science project focusing on various phases, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and modeling using Python. The project involves the utilization of Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and building a simple linear regression model.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning

- **Accessing Public API and Creating a Dataset**
  - Python code snippet demonstrates accessing a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and saving the fetched data as a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning with Pandas**
  - Illustrates the process of cleaning a dataset using Pandas, handling missing values, and removing outliers.

### Phase 2: Analysis and Visualization

- **Analysis of Dataset and Graph Generation**
  - Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices.
- **Linear Regression**
- **Linear Regression Using Provided Datasets**
  - Demonstrates the process of training a simple linear regression model using Pandas and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset Information

- The project uses various datasets for different phases.
- Links to dataset sources are provided within the code snippets.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Review the code snippets and adjust paths or API endpoints as needed.
4. Run the scripts or notebooks in the respective project phases.
